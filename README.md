# Hello-World
My first repository
This is my first step into a completely new world. I have been keen to learn more about coding and developing and I guess the best way to learn is to do. Feeling nervcited - a word my daughter introduced to me yesterday that fits brilliantly. I hope I don't get too lost or make too much mess!
